Client:
Checks each cubelet, gives a weighting of 0, 1, or 2
For each cubelet with a tied weighting:
Calls the helper method, passing it a new cube and the number of cubelet to solve for
Each helper method returns the solve moves (as the client already knows its cube)
The solve moves are compressed and weighted
Uncompressed solve moves are added to offical moves
Temp. cube replaces original (unmodified) cube.

Helper:
gets a cubelet and number passed to it.
Solves for the specific directed cubelet
Adds uncompressed moves to string
Checks the remaining cubelets, gives a weighting 1, 2, or 3
Calls the helper method, passing it a new cube and the number of cubelet to solve for
Each helper method returns the solve moves
The solve moves are compressed and weighted
Uncompressed solve moves are added to returned moves


Check:
Checks each cubelet, gives a weighting of 0, 1, or 2
For each cubelet with a tied weighting:
Calls move/solve to move/solve for the decided cubelet
Decides best move/move to keep
Checks if solved
Calls itself again


Move/Solve:
Moves/solves, returns moves
