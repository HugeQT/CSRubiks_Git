ORIENTATION:
FOR EDGES:
IF:
Top or Bottom color faces either up or down, or is a L or R move from facing up or down, then its orientation = 0
ELSE:
IF:
Front or Back color faces either forwards or backwards or is a L or R move from facing forwards or backwards, then its orientation = 0 
Else:
Orientation = 1
THEREFORE:
F or B/F' or B' moves will flip orientation, but nothing else

FOR CORNERS:
Focused exclusively on which color is facing up or down 
If Top or Bottom color then its orientation = 0
If Front or Back color then its orientation = 1
If Left or Right color then its orientation = 2 

THEREFORE
All ² moves will not change orientation
All U or D moves will not change orientation

For a R or R', L or L' move:
Switch to side facing front or back
For a F or F', B or B' move:
Switch to side facing left or right

From position 0,
For a R or R', L or L'move:
0->1
For a F or F', B or B' move:
0->2

From position 1,
For a R or R', L or L'move:
1->0
For a F or F', B or B' move:
1->2

From position 2,
For a R or R', L or L'move:
2->1
For a F or F', B or B' move:
2->0

This patten is recognized with U (top) face as white, F (front) face as red, R (right) face as blue. 
For corners, starting with the back left corner (WGO) and initializing top-to-bottom, back-to-front, then left-to-right.
For edges, starting with the upper-back-middle edge (WO) and initializing top-to-bottom, back-to-front, then left-to-right.
For faces, starting with the top face (white), and initializing top-to-bottom, back-to-front, then left-to-right.
